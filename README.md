# touch-bar-restart
A simple automator script - restarts the MacBook touch bar control strip (along with the escape key for 2018 and older models with touchbar)

Click [here](https://github.com/zacharyspaton/touch-bar-restart/releases) to download it

Nothing more than a shell command made quick and easy to run with a .app you can chuck in your dock
```
pkill "Touch Bar agent";
killall "ControlStrip";
```

Thanks Marcus for the icon
